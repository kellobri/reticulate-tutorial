# An Opinionated Tutorial for Getting Started with Reticulate 

The [reticulate package](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate) is an actively evolving project. This _opinionated getting started guide_ is also likely to morph and develop over time. Feel free to submit issues or PRs for any changes that seem useful and I'll do my best to review them. 

## What is Reticulate?

From the [Reticulate documentation website](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html:

> Reticulate embeds a Python session within your R session, enabling seamless, high-performance interoperability. If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, reticulate can dramatically streamline your workflow!
